Is the Magento 2 Store Pickup with Locator Extension Really Necessary?
With the Magento 2 Store Pickup with Locator extension, customers can conveniently order online and pick up their items at a nearby physical store whenever they want.

This extension helps reduce shipping costs and provides customers with more flexible shipping options and delivery times.

Each store has its own information page, displaying complete details such as address, phone number, email, fax, website link, and images.

Additionally, you can enhance your store locator page for local SEO by adding meta titles, meta descriptions, meta keywords, and URL keys. Local SEO helps local customers find your products more easily through search engines. You can also use rich snippets to display your store information prominently in search results.
